Hey now
Letters burning by my bed for you
Hey now
I can feel my instincts here for you
Hey now
By my bed for you
Hey now
Hey now
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh you know it is frightening
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh you know it's like lightning
Hey now, now
Hey now
Letters burning by my bed for you
Hey now
Leave it to the wayside like you do, for you
Imagination calling mirrors for you
Hey now
Hey now
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh you know it is frightening
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh you know it's like lightning
Now, now, now, now
Hey now, now
Hey now, now
Hey now, now
Hey now, now
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
